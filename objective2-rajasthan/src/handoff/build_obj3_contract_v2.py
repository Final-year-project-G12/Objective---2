=========================================
G12 (O2, 2026-10-27) - regenerated Objective 3 environment contract. Writes
results/obj3_environment_contract_rajasthan_v2.json and leaves the old contract untouched.

It keeps the generic parts of the old contract (limits, action set, safety shield text, reward skeleton, acceptance tests),
because those did not change, and replaces what the rework changed:
  * simulator: multi-node (N=10) tank, dt = 150 s, local-time demand, inner-volume PCM mass + wall mass, O1 top-3 PCMs
  * per regime: the CHOSEN design, the best design of each other O1 PCM, their water-only twins at the same flow,
    select-year and held-out-test results (all of them, including where PCM does not help), the WP6 band
  * weather: explore / select / test years are now real (src/weather/roles.py); O3 must respect the roles
  * state vector gains the stratification fields (top/bottom temperature)
  * reward terms follow the WP1 metrics instead of annual E_load
Every number is read from a file under results/; nothing is computed here.
