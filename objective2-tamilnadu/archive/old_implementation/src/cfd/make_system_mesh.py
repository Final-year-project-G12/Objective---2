src/cfd/make_system_mesh.py
==============================
Writes a 2-D planar Fluent/Gambit ASCII `.msh` of the WHOLE system in one
domain: the storage tank, the PCM capsule array inside it, and the flat-plate
collector panel beside it.

WHY A SEPARATE MESH FROM make_tank_mesh.py. That one is a bare axisymmetric
tank for the G4 draw case -- one fluid zone, no capsules, no panel. This one
exists to SHOW the structure (tank + PCM + panel) and to let Fluent solve
conduction/convection across all of it, which needs several cell zones:

    water      tank water, minus the capsules                  (fluid)
    pcm        the capsule interiors                           (solid, PCM props)
    shell      the aluminium capsule walls                     (solid)
    panel      collector channel water                         (fluid)
    absorber   collector absorber plate                         (solid)
    riser      the pipe run connecting panel outlet to tank     (fluid)

PLANAR, NOT AXISYMMETRIC -- and that is a deliberate trade. The tank alone is
a revolved rectangle, so make_tank_mesh.py uses Fluent's axisymmetric solver
and gets true annular cell volumes. The moment the panel sits BESIDE the tank
the assembly has no axis of revolution, so this mesh is a vertical planar
slice. Consequence: absolute litres and kWh from this mesh are per unit depth
and are NOT comparable to the node model. This mesh is for structure,
temperature fields and melt-front shape. Every energy number that gets
reported comes from the node model or from the axisymmetric draw case.

HOW THE ZONES ARE BUILT. A single structured quad grid covers the bounding
box; each cell is then tagged by where its centroid falls (inside a capsule
-> pcm or shell; inside the panel channel -> panel; etc.). Cells are
renumbered so each zone is one contiguous id block, because the Fluent format
declares a cell zone as a first..last range. Faces between two DIFFERENT cell
zones become coupled walls so conjugate heat transfer is solved across them;
faces inside one zone are interior.

Format: (2) dims, (10) nodes, (12) cell zones, (13) face zones, (45) names.
A face carries (left cell, right cell) with 0 meaning outside the domain.
