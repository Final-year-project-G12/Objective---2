"""
src/optimize/baseline.py
===========================
O2 G8 - the paired baseline. Decision (user, 2026-10-26): every PCM design is compared with a
WATER-ONLY tank at the SAME flow, weather year, demand, shield and tank model. Flow is continuous, so the
plain tank is simulated on a flow grid per (regime, year) and interpolated (monotone PCHIP); the interpolation
error is measured against exact plain runs in tests/test_design_space.py.

Grids are built per weather-year ROLE: 'explore' and 'select' freely; the held-out 'test' baseline may only be
built after roles.acquire_test_lock() (load_point_year enforces it).
