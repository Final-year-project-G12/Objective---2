src/optimize/surrogates_advanced.py
======================================
Two additional surrogate families, added to the three in `surrogates.py`
(nn_ensemble / xgboost / rsm_quadratic) because the review asked for
something more advanced than XGBoost.

ADDITIVE ON PURPOSE. Her three families stay exactly as they are and keep
competing, because the only honest way to answer "is this better than
XGBoost" is to measure it against XGBoost on the same folds of the same
data. An earlier attempt at this swapped XGBoost out on the strength of a
SYNTHETIC benchmark, where a GP beat it by 11.2x on RMSE. That did not
transfer: on the real DOE, XGBoost won 21 of 27 groups and the GP came
third. The lesson is kept here as a rule -- the bake-off decides, not the
model's reputation.

  gp_ard        Gaussian-process regression with an ANISOTROPIC (ARD)
                Matern-5/2 kernel plus a fitted white-noise term, one model
                per target. Why this and not RBF: RBF assumes an infinitely
                smooth response, which over-smooths the kink where the PCM
                enters its melt band; Matern-5/2 is twice differentiable --
                smooth enough for an optimiser to follow, not so smooth
                that it erases structure. Two things it gives that no tree
                can: an exact closed-form posterior standard deviation
                (so active learning can sample where the model is really
                unsure, instead of where a tree committee happens to
                disagree), and a learned length scale per input, which
                doubles as a sensitivity readout cross-checkable against
                the Taguchi ANOVA.

  stacked       Out-of-fold stacked ensemble: each base family (GP, XGB,
                RSM, NN) predicts the held-out folds, and a non-negative
                ridge meta-learner is fitted on those out-of-fold
                predictions, per target. This is strictly more capable than
                picking one winner -- if the families make different errors
                it beats all of them, and if one dominates the meta-learner
                collapses onto it. Non-negative weights keep it from
                "fixing" one model with the negative of another, which
                overfits badly at n~128.

Both expose `fit(X, Y)` / `predict(X)` with the same shapes as her
classes, so `g8_s3_compare.py`-style code can use them interchangeably.
Feature matrix and TARGETS are imported from her module so the two sets
can never drift apart.
