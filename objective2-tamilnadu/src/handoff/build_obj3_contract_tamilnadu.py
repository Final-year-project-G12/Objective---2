src/handoff/build_obj3_contract_tamilnadu.py
=============================================
Builds the Objective 3 environment contract for TAMIL NADU from the CURRENT
Objective 2 results. Writes results/obj3_environment_contract_tamilnadu_v3.json.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`build_obj3_contract_v2.py` is hardcoded for Rajasthan: it reads
`results/obj3_environment_contract_rajasthan.json` (absent from this tree) and
writes `..._rajasthan_v2.json`. It cannot produce a Tamil Nadu contract. The
only Tamil Nadu contract that existed (`objective3/obj3_environment_contract
_tamilnadu.json`, 2026-10-27) describes a SUPERSEDED run -- n-Hexacosane C26 /
n-Pentacosane C25, radial and single-layer arrangements, 32-35 capsules,
50 L tank, 1.5 m2 collector. None of that matches the released designs.

What is reused and what is rebuilt
----------------------------------
REUSED from the 2026-10-27 contract, because these did not change:
    action_space, reset_scenarios, acceptance_test_before_drl_training,
    dynamic_state_schema (then extended), demand_profile_file
REBUILT from live files, because all of these did change:
    static_design_per_regime  <- results/g10_selection_r{0,1,2}.json
    held_out_test             <- results/g10_heldout_results.csv + the lock
    repeatability_band        <- results/wp6_band.csv
    global_limits, safety_shield, time_step_s <- configs/system_config_shared.yaml
    weather_sequences         <- src/weather/roles.py (the real year roles)
    reward_function           <- rebuilt on the WP1 window metrics
ADDED, carrying the 2026-11-09 corrections pass into the contract itself:
    design_space_caveats      (the design is NOT a global optimum)
    temperature_specification (the one master table)
    verification_status       (simulator verification / CFD / experiment)

Every number is read from a file under results/ or configs/. Nothing is
computed here and nothing is typed by hand.
